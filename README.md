‚ú® Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is ready ‚ú®.

[Learn more about this workspace setup and its capabilities](https://nx.dev/getting-started/tutorials/react-monorepo-tutorial?utm_source=nx_project&amp;utm_medium=readme&amp;utm_campaign=nx_projects) or run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what was created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

> **Module Federation**: See [MODULE_FEDERATION.md](./MODULE_FEDERATION.md) for usage examples.

## Use Cases

This project demonstrates a **scalable architecture** that starts as a monorepo and can easily evolve into micro-frontends, showcasing several key architectural patterns:

### üöÄ **Scalable Architecture Journey**
- **Phase 1 - Monorepo**: Start with all modules as static libraries in a single repository
- **Phase 2 - Hybrid**: Mix static and remote modules as teams grow
- **Phase 3 - Micro-Frontends**: Extract modules to separate repositories with independent deployments
- **Zero Refactoring**: Same codebase supports all phases through environment configuration

### üèóÔ∏è **Module Federation Architecture**
- **Independent Module Development**: Module1 and Module2 can be developed, built, and deployed independently
- **Dynamic Loading**: Modules can be loaded either statically (as libraries) or dynamically (via Module Federation)
- **Shared State Management**: Zustand store demonstrates state sharing across modules
- **Shared UI Components**: Common UI components (Loading, CountView) shared between modules

### üîÑ **Flexible Deployment Strategies**
- **Hybrid Loading**: Mix static and remote modules in the same application
- **Environment-Based Configuration**: Control module loading behavior via environment variables
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when remote modules fail to load
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Development experience with live reloading

### üéØ **Real-World Scenarios**

#### **Startup Growth Strategy**
- **Start**: Monorepo with all modules static (simple setup, fast development)
- **Scale**: Gradually migrate modules to remote deployment as teams grow
- **Maintain**: Shared dependencies and state management across all phases
- **Benefit**: Independent release cycles without architectural rewrites

#### **Legacy System Integration**
- Integrate new React modules into existing applications
- Share authentication, routing, and state management
- Maintain consistent UI/UX across different technology stacks
- Enable gradual migration without big-bang rewrites

#### **Multi-Team Development**
- Independent teams can own and deploy their modules
- Shared design system and component library
- Centralized routing and navigation
- Consistent development experience across teams

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Features**
- **React 19 + TypeScript**: Modern React with full type safety
- **Material-UI**: Consistent design system
- **React Router**: Client-side routing with module integration
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management
- **Vite**: Fast build tooling with Module Federation support
- **Nx**: Monorepo management with intelligent caching

## Run tasks

To run the dev server for your app, use:

```sh
npx nx serve single-page-app
```

To create a production bundle:

```sh
npx nx build single-page-app
```

To see all available targets to run for a project, run:

```sh
npx nx show project single-page-app
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects.

To generate a new application, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:app apps/demo
```

To generate a new library, use:

```sh
npx nx g @nx/react:lib libraries/mylib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

[Learn more about Nx plugins &raquo;](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) | [Browse the plugin registry &raquo;](https://nx.dev/plugin-registry?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Set up CI!

### Step 1

To connect to Nx Cloud, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx connect
```

Connecting to Nx Cloud ensures a [fast and scalable CI](https://nx.dev/ci/intro/why-nx-cloud?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) pipeline. It includes features such as:

- [Remote caching](https://nx.dev/ci/features/remote-cache?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/ci/features/distribute-task-execution?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Automated e2e test splitting](https://nx.dev/ci/features/split-e2e-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)
- [Task flakiness detection and rerunning](https://nx.dev/ci/features/flaky-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

### Step 2

Use the following command to configure a CI workflow for your workspace:

```sh
npx nx g ci-workflow
```
